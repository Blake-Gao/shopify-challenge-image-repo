# Shopify Image Repository

Boiler plate code pulled from https://github.com/MLH/mlh-hackathon-flask-starter

Built using python, flask, sqlite, and aws for image storage

Simple application that allows you to buy images/paintings. 

Available images for purchase are on the left. Click to purchase. Purchased images are in the middle column.
Currently does not support uploading images but can easily be extended to do so.

Visit https://bgao-shopify-image-repo.herokuapp.com/ to use the application.

PS not a UI/UX designer and since this application is mainly backend focused it may not be the prettiest
